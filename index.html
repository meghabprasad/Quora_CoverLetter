Having spent several years preparing to become a doctor, deciding to pivot to an entirely different career field was not easy for me.

I am truly excited to hear that Quora also ensures that inclusivity is a priority.<p><h5>My educational background</h5><p>Having a background in human research and human behavior, I will bring a novel approach to building products at Quora, a platform geared toward social interaction. I have taken numerous courses on psychology and neurobiology of how human brain functions in response to technology.
